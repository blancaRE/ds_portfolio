# Adversarial attack
Neural networks are a family of algorithms widely used in machine learning, but also have weaknesses. In this project, I use the pre-trained convolutional neural network model Inceptionv3 to perform image classification. I perform modifications in the input image to predict a wrong class, the taget desired class.
